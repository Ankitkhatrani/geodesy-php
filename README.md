Geodesy-PHP
=============

Geodesy-PHP is a PHP port of some known geodesic functions for getting distance from a known point A to a known point B, given their latitude and longitude (good for working out distances between latitude/longitude data provided by Google Geolocation or any RESTful APIs).

It also supports conversion between units of length, between Geographical position to Cartesian, and between different Reference Datums.

It provides distance calculations by:

1. [Spherical Law of Cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_law_of_cosines) 

2. [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)

3. [Vincenty's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenty%27s_formulae)

4. [Hubeny's formula](https://www.geo.tuwien.ac.at/fileadmin/editors/VGI/VGI_195403_Hubeny.pdf)

5. [Thomas' formula](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/703541.pdf)

6. [Andoyer-Lambert formula](https://navlib.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/admiralty-manual-of-navigation-vol-1-1964-english501c.pdf)
