Geodesy-PHP
=============

Geodesy-PHP is a port of some known geodesic/math functions for getting distance from a known point A to a known point B given their coordinates (good for working out distances between different latitude/longitude data provided by Google Geolocation or any RESTful APIs).

It also supports conversion between units of length, Polar position to Cartesian coordinates, and different Reference Datums.

It provides distance calculations by:

1. [Spherical Law of Cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_law_of_cosines) 

2. [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)

3. [Vincenty's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenty%27s_formulae)

4. [Hubeny's formula](https://www.geo.tuwien.ac.at/fileadmin/editors/VGI/VGI_195403_Hubeny.pdf)

5. [Thomas' formula](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/703541.pdf)

6. [Andoyer-Lambert formula](https://navlib.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/admiralty-manual-of-navigation-vol-1-1964-english501c.pdf)
