Geodesy-PHP
=============

Geodesy-PHP is a PHP port of some known geodesic functions for getting distance from a known point A to a known point B, given their latitude and longitude (good for working out distances between latitude/longitude data provided by Google Maps or any Restful APIs).

This has been helpful to me at a time when working out the distance between different vendors and the user's location (and check if they're within a certain range).

It provides distance calculations by:

1. [Spherical Law of Cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_law_of_cosines) 

2. [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)

3. [Vincenty's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenty%27s_formulae)
